1. Objective/Purpose of the Project

ABC Company is considering purchasing shares in Apple and the S&P 500 index, with the goal of maximizing profit over the next two years. The purpose of this project is to analyze the financial risks associated with these investments by assessing their historical performance over the past three years. The analysis will help the company determine whether the potential risks are manageable or unaffordable.

2. Current Practices and Limitations

Currently, ABC Company does not have a structured approach to analyzing historical performance before making investment decisions. They rely on basic market reports and stock data. However, this approach lacks detailed insights such as volatility, beta, and risk-adjusted returns, limiting their ability to evaluate potential risks effectively.

3. Innovative Approach

This project utilizes advanced financial analysis techniques by leveraging Python libraries such as pandas, yfinance, numpy, and pyfolio. These tools will allow us to automate data fetching, calculate key financial metrics (e.g., volatility, beta, Sharpe ratio), and visualize cumulative returns. By employing these advanced techniques, we can provide ABC Company with a clearer picture of the risks involved.

4. Stakeholders and Impact

The primary stakeholders are ABC Company’s finance and investment teams. The analysis will support them in making more informed investment decisions regarding Apple and the S&P 500 index. By understanding the risk metrics such as volatility, beta, Sharpe ratio, and VaR, the teams can assess if the potential returns justify the risks, leading to better risk management.

5. Risks and Rewards

Risks:
Data quality could impact the accuracy of results. Missing or incorrect data may lead to flawed calculations.
Market conditions could change, rendering historical data less predictive of future performance.
Rewards:
With better insight into risk factors (e.g., volatility, beta, and maximum drawdown), ABC Company can avoid investments that carry excessive risk.
By calculating risk-adjusted returns, the company can identify potential investments that offer high returns for relatively low risk.
6. Cost and Resources

The project involves minimal financial cost, as it leverages free Python libraries (pandas, yfinance, etc.) and open data sources. However, the project will require the time and expertise of a data analyst and possibly a financial advisor to interpret results accurately. The investment in human resources is expected to be around 30 hours of work.

7. Timeline and Milestones

Week 1: Data collection and cleaning (using yfinance to fetch historical data for Apple and S&P 500).
Week 2: Calculation of key financial metrics (volatility, beta, Sharpe ratio, VaR).
Week 3: Visualization of daily returns, cumulative returns, and interpretation of results.
Week 4: Final report preparation and presentation to ABC Company’s investment team.
8. Success Metrics

The success of the project will be measured by:

The ability to accurately calculate financial risk metrics such as volatility, beta, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.
Clear and actionable insights provided to ABC Company about the risk levels associated with investing in Apple and the S&P 500.
Positive feedback from the investment team based on the usefulness and clarity of the report.
Summary of Key Findings
Volatility: Apple's daily volatility is approximately 2.11%, and annual volatility is 33.24%, indicating substantial variation in returns.
Beta: Apple has a beta of 1.1897, suggesting it is more volatile than the market, meaning it moves approximately 18.97% more than the S&P 500.
Sharpe Ratio: A relatively low Sharpe ratio (0.0561) suggests that the returns provided by Apple may not fully justify the risk.
VaR: At a 95% confidence level, the Value at Risk (VaR) is -0.0324, indicating potential losses of approximately 3.24% in a downturn.
Maximum Drawdown: The maximum drawdown for Apple is 31.43%, showing a significant historical decline in stock value from its peak.
Advice for the Investor
While Apple's positive Sharpe ratio and alpha show potential for risk-adjusted returns, the high beta, volatility, and negative Treynor ratio highlight the risk involved in these investments. Investors need to carefully assess their risk tolerance and consider portfolio diversification. A financial advisor can help tailor the risk strategy to the company's long-term goals.

This report ensures that ABC Company makes an informed decision about its investment in Apple and the S&P 500, by providing a thorough risk analysis using data-driven methods.
